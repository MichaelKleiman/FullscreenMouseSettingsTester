A simple program for testing mouse sensitivity. Enter the number of (horizontal) pixels you want it to move, how many steps you want it to take, and how long you want it to delay before starting the run.

I made this to reveal the details of fullscreen applications' mouse input handling 
(for example, not allowing mouse acceleration to be fully disabled, 
or not specifying how to achieve my deisred 1:1 ratio of input:motion

Run this with Python 3 from Python.org. It appears that the mouse only moves properly while it is on the computer's primary display.
